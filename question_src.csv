1,Accuracy Requirements,What level of accuracy is required for this facility?,"The client will have a target required accuracy for the RTLS system being implemented to support mobile duress for the facility. Although each locationing technology has a range of possible final accuracies which is dependent on factors including but not limited to vendor, deployment, and specific construction characteristics, there are general accuracy ranges for each RTLS technology type. It is important that a technology is chosen that is physically capable of satisfying the client's accuracy requirements for mobile duress within their healthcare facility."
2,New/Existing Facility,Is this a new or existing facility?,"Whether the facility is new or existing will change the amount of flexibility there is in the solution. Green-field sites tend to have more flexibility in how the final solution is implemented, whereas brown-field sites may have to be compatible or also might be able to utilise some of the existing infrastructure."
3a,Existing WLAN,Is there an existing WLAN (Wi-Fi) Network?,An existing Wi-Fi network could be utilised depending on its current deployment.
3b,Existing WLAN,What grade is the existing WLAN?,"The grade of the existing Wi-Fi network is crucial in determining the viability of using it for RTLS services to support mobile duress. 
Data-grade networks have the lowest requirements in terms of their signal strength at any given point within the facility, but therefore have the slowest speed available for data transfer. These networks are only used for the transfer of files.
Voice-grade networks are used for Voice-over-Internet-Protocol (VoIP) applications and have higher requirements to be able to support continuous voice services over the Wi-Fi network.
RTLS-grade networks have a much higher requirement, including multiple access points with particular signal strengths seen by a device at any point where there is expected service.

In general, RTLS-grade networks can be utilised for mobile duress"
4,Budget,What level of budget is allocated to the Mobile Duress System?,"The budget allocated to the mobile duress system will be necessary to determine which types of technology are affordable to the client's project. While there are price variations between vendors, there are general guidelines as to which technologies are more expensive and which are more budget-friendly. Lower cost will have a trade-off with the achievable accuracy."
5a,Budget,What level of budget is allocated to the Mobile Duress System?,"The budget allocated to the mobile duress system will be necessary to determine which types of technology are affordable to the client's project. While there are price variations between vendors, there are general guidelines as to which technologies are more expensive and which are more budget-friendly. Lower cost will have a trade-off with the achievable accuracy."
5b,Budget,What level of budget is allocated to the Mobile Duress System?,"The budget allocated to the mobile duress system will be necessary to determine which types of technology are affordable to the client's project. While there are price variations between vendors, there are general guidelines as to which technologies are more expensive and which are more budget-friendly. Lower cost will have a trade-off with the achievable accuracy."
6,Existing Infrastructure,Is there a lot of existing cabling or services infrastructure in the area of works?,Environments with large amounts of cabling or services infrastructure such as hydraulic piping or mechanical ductwork are more suited to RTLS solutions that require less cables or can utilise their cabling in more efficient ways.
7,Handsets,What type of handsets are intending to be deployed?,"The type and capability of the clinical handsets that are being deployed at the facility will affect the options available for RTLS. For example. a clinical handsets' Wi-Fi, bluetooth, RF or DECT radio capability could be utliised as the devices whose locations are tracked in real time by the installed RTLS. Therefore, it may be beneficial to choose a locating technology that matches up with the available technology on the clinical handsets being deployed."
9a,Building Materials,What type of walls primarily make up the facility? (between rooms where RTLS is desired),"Some technologies are more heavily affected by thicker walls due to their signal characteristics, and some are still able to perform well due to the higher density of their locators (e.g. having one per room)."
9b,Building Materials,Is the building primarily made of brick/concrete internal walls?,Thicker walls made of brick or concrete will more heavily attenuate radio signals. This will in particular affect the performance of RTLS technologies with higher signal strength requirements.
9c,Building Materials,Are there many glass panels in internal areas?,"The presence of many internal glass panels will impede radio signals' propagation. In particular, the performance of RTLS technologies with higher signal strength requirements will have their performance negatively affected."
9d,Outdoor Locations,Are there bright outdoor locations that require RTLS coverage?,Bright locations are unsuitable for the operation of RF-based RTLS (infrared-based signal only).
9e,Plant Room Coverage,Is RTLS coverage required in plant rooms?,Plant rooms have high amounts of electromagnetic interference (EMI) due to the operation of the plant equipment. RTLS technologies with higher signal requirements will be more negativelly affected by this.
