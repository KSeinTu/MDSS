15,"The existing WLAN is below RTLS-grade, therefore it is generally more financially feasible to implement a separate bluetooth locator network for RTLS than to re-design the existing Wi-Fi Network to be of RTLS-grade. RTLS-grade networks require a device to see three WAPs at a minimum required criteria of signal strengths to accurately determine its location. Additionally, redesigning a WLAN is not a simple matter of installing additional WAPs, since this can cause interference issues between neighbouring WAPs."
16,"The existing WLAN is below RTLS-grade, but if there are only specific zones that are not RTLS-grade, then a small network of BLE locators can be installed to provide accurate RTLS in those areas. If majority or all the network is below RTLS-grade, this option will not be feasible."
17,"The existing WLAN is below RTLS-grade, therefore to implement a Wi-Fi based RTLS, an entirely new WLAN will have to be designed and installed which will likely be of significantly higher cost than an alternative using a different locationing technology."
18,"The existing WLAN is RTLS-grade, so despite it being possible to implement a BLE locator network, it might be more sensible to utilise the existing RTLS-grade Wi-Fi network to provide location services for the Mobile Duress System"
19,"The existing WLAN is RTLS-grade, so bluetooth beacons could be used in tandem with the existing Wireless Access Points to create more precise zones for location tracking. This would in turn further narrow down the location of a staff-member in distress, though this further level of performance may not be needed."
20,"The existing WLAN is RTLS-grade, therefore it is sensible to utilise this existing network to provide the location services throughout the facility."

23,"BLE-based systems are suited to low-budget since the cost of each locator point is significantly cheaper to alternatives such as wireless access points for Wi-Fi. Additionally, the cost of the individual locator tags is relatively low (approximately in the $60 range) and the battery life is relatively long (up to approximately 7 years) which significantly reduces the on-going costs of the solution."
24,Hybrid systems are suitable cost-effective alternatives to a complete Wi-Fi based solution. Bluetooth locators are used in areas of the Wi-Fi network that are not RTLS-grade which may be more cost-effective than redesigning the existing Wi-Fi network while maintaining the required level of location accuracy from the RTLS system. Finer cost details will have to evaluated through assessing the specific number of locators / wireless access points that would need to be installed compared to other solutions.
25,"Wi-Fi based solutions are a more costly RTLS solution due to a few main reasons. The cost of each wireless access point is high (in the $2000-$3000 range), a lot of these access points are required in the facility to achieve the requirements of an RTLS-grade WLAN, the locator tags for staff are more expensive compared to alternatives such as BLE and have a shorter battery life (increasing long-term cost of the solution)."

Additionally, the cost of the individual locator tags is relatively low (approximately in the $60 range) and the battery life is relatively long (up to approximately 7 years) which significantly reduces the on-going costs of the solution. However, since there is an existing RTLS-grade Wi-Fi network, the higher operating costs might be comparable to the cost of installing an entirely new BLE locator network, therefore further budgeting work for the individual project should be performed to compare the two solutions more effectively."
35,"Wi-Fi based solutions are a more costly RTLS solution due to more expensive locator tags and access points compared to other technologies such as BLE. However, the overall cost of the solution will be significantly reduced since there is already an RTLS-grade network in the facility. Further budgeting evaluation should be conducted to find which solution would provide better value to the client long-term, since the Wi-FI solution will have higher long-term costs but alternatives might have higher initial costs to install their locator networks."

60,"Using a personal tag/pendant is a good budget-friendly option if there is already an existing deployment of handsets that and there is no design intention of integrating these handsets (or new handsets) into the mobile duress system. Note: The tag or pendant that is purchased for the solution has to match the technology type of the RTLS infrastructure, so it is unlikely that one tag would be able to be used in two different types of RTLS. This is particularly relevant in cases where staff may be expected to traverse between sites that have different RTLS technologies but would be expected to use the same tag, since the tag would need to be able to communicate to both types of beacons or access points used in those two sites."

49,"The thick walls within the facility do not heavily affect the BLE solution, since locators are typically placed with high density, e.g. one per room."
59,"The thick walls within the facility will impact the effectiveness of a solution that utilises Wi-Fi access points for its real-time location tracking, since there are higher signal quality and data rate requirements for Wi-Fi based RTLS to operate effectively.
