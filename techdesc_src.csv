BLE,"Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) based Real-Time Locating Systems are a newer technology that has been developing in the RTLS industry. Its structure is that it uses locators that listen for a BLE signal from a tag or BLE device then relay that information back to a location engine via an aggregator and the facility's telecommunications network. The locator tag or BLE device in the context of mobile duress would be either a personal duress tag or a smartphone handset that the staff carry on their person.
Typically beacons are placed per room and operate using an angle-of-arrival techniques with a cone of vision to calculate a tag's location within a room. This means that the locator beacons must have overlapping or at least bordering cones of vision within a space in order to get full RTLS coverage. BLE RTLS solutions offer high accuracy locationing, down to within 10cm using dedicated BLE tags, with lower accuracies being available if BLE devices such as mobile smart phones are used as locator tags. Note that the accuracy achievable may also be dependent on the license that is purchased from the supplying solution vendor. The technology itself allows for cheaper and smaller tags than other RTLS technologies with longer battery-life due to its low-power nature. Once deployed, BLE-based RTLS does not need to be recalibrated upon changes to the network such as in the event of replacing faulty beacons, unlike some other RTLS technologies such as Wi-Fi."
Wi-Fi BLE Hybrid,"Wi-Fi BLE Hybrid solutions are somewhat flexible in nature and can be implmented differently depending on a facilities needs. However, a hybrid solution will be comprised of Wireless Access Points for the WLAN accompanied by BLE beacons which act in a complementary manner to provide location services to the facility. This offers a cost/performance compromise between implementing a more expensive and less flexible Wi-Fi based RTLS and designing/installing a completely new and separate BLE locator network.
A typical use case of this type of RTLS is when a facility already has a Wi-Fi network that is close to RTLS-grade but has some zones that do not satisfy the requirements to be considered RTLS-grade. In those cases additional BLE beacons are deployed to offer more precise zoning without the need to redesign and modify the existing WLAN network."
Wi-Fi,"A Wi-Fi based RTLS is a well-known solution for mobile duress services that has been implemented in numerous existing facilities. It utilises its Wireless Access Points (WAPs) which are normally used for either data transfer services or Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services for the purposes of real-time location tracking of a locator tag. In the mobile duress context, the locator tag can be either a personal duress tag or a mobile smartphone that the staff carries on their person. When designing an RTLS-grade Wi-Fi network, the primary WAP received signal strength needs to be at -65dBm signal strength and secondary and tertiary WAPs at -75dBm or higher. 
Financially, the long-term costs of the Wi-Fi solutions are higher than some other technologies such as BLE due to the following reasons. A large number of WAPs are required for the network to be RTLS-grade, each of which is of considerable price, recalibration maintenance is required everytime the network undergoes some sort of hardware change (such as an access point changing), the tags are more expensive to purchase and replace, and the battery-life of the tags is not as long as other solution types. The main benefit from implementing a Wi-Fi based RTLS for mobile duress is in the instances of either an existing or a strong push to implement an RTLS-grade Wi-Fi network. There may be some other fringe cases also."
RF,"RF-based RTLS is a well-documented solution that has wide use within justice applications along with some implementations in healthcare. The architecture uses several antennas, each of which indicate a zone, and the person/device being located is a transmitter device carried on the staff's person. The received signal strengths from the antennas in the building then become an indication of the zone that the person is located in.
The main overall benefits from this solution come from its well-established presence in existing facilities, its reliability and its lower cost, however it is not as accurate or complex a locating system as some other technologies, and in the case of some vendors is reaching the end of its life."
DECT,"DECT (Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications) refers specifically to a common telecommunicaitons protocol that is used amongst landline phones. However, it can be used to support mobile handsets within a facility. It uses a connection between a handset and a basestation (via  an antenna or repeater) to facilitate telephony services. Typically DECT handsets are more rugged handset solutions than smart-phone type solutions, which may be beneficial in the specific operating circumstances of the staff. Typically DECT has long range capability (~50m indoors) and is more resilient to interefence than Wi-Fi."
